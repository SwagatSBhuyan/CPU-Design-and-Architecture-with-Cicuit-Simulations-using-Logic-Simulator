# CPU-Design-and-Architecture-with-Cicuit-Simulations-using-Logic-Simulator
Computers have come a long way from mechanical devices capable of maybe one calculation per second, to CPUs running at kilohertz and megahertz speeds. In the early days of electronic computing, processors were typically made faster by improving the switching time of the transistors inside the chip - the ones that make up all the logic gates, ALUs, Control Units, etc. But just making transistors faster and more efficient only went so far, so processor designers have developed various techniques to boost performance allowing not only simple instructions to run fast, but also performing much more sophisticated operations using circuits instead of using simple ALU instructions. This is what is covered in making an advanced CPU â€“ the architecture and organization of various aspects that make up a CPU.
